<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECTS -->
## 	üë© Authors üë®

Our group consists of 2 people:
* Martyna Baran
* Zuzanna Jarlaczy≈Ñska



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## üìñ Topic

This repository gathers 3 practice projects associated with a subject Real-Time and Embedded Systems at the Universidad Loyola. You can find both written reporst and corresponding codes. 

<!-- practice 1 -->
## üö∞ Practice 1: Multitasking
### Four Tanks control example 
The objective of this first practice is to use the concepts of multitasking related to Real Time Linux (xenomai) and apply them to a realistic case. As a study case, a well-known and commonly used plant at the academic level, the 4-tank plant, will be used. Our fundamental objective will be to create a real-time control system and apply it to a model of this plant. This system will then be tested using the matlab simulation.

<!-- practice 2 -->
## üí° Practice 2: Introduction to Embedded systems (STM32F767ZI)


This practice is an introduction to embedded systems. These systems will be used in the project related to the curse: 'Real Time and embedded systems / Concurrent and real time systems. The topics introduced during this session are the following:
 * STM32F767ZI Connected to the Laptop and STM32CubeIDE software introduction.
 * Ozone software introduction for debugging.
 * Introduction to C/C++ Code for GPIO management.

<!-- practice 3 -->

## üî¶ Practice 3: Introduction to Vxwork 7 environment
This practice is an introduction to Vxwork 7 SDK environment. This system will be used in the curse: 'Real Time and embedded systems / Concurrent and real time systems. The topics introduced during this session are the following:
* Installation of Micosoft Visual code.
* Installation of QEMU software.
* Installation of compillers LLVM-14.06
* Installation of Vxworks 7 SDK for windows.
* Installation of Visual code plugin for VxWorks.
* Running an example
* Using the new tools to solve:
  *  reader and writer problem
  * dinner's philosopher problem
